    Implements the majority rule model of opinion dynamics.
    One model parameter is the state of the initial population controlled by the proportion of
    "infected" individuals.
    Second model parameter is size of groups, "q". Better to have "q" odd.
    Applies to complete network setting (should not crash for other networks, but would not make sense).
